To Whom It May Concern:

I write today to inform you that it's all falling apart. What little remained of the thin verneer of civility we all imagined to exist has been cast aside &, for extra measure, set on fire.

Now is the time of uncertainty & cruelty.

I don't know what will happen next. But I do know that it will be worse. And, I do know that it will be done in the name of hatred & destruction.

I wish I was wrong, but I'm not.

If there's a question to be asked, it's, "How how much longer will it take for the denialists to actually see what is right in front of their eyes?" This matters, because when enough of them do finally see, that's when the shit will really hit the fan.
